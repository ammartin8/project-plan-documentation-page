                        <p>Git is a version control system that is used to keep track of changes made in your
                            development project. Git is also the most widely used version control system for both
                            commercial and open-source projects due to its ability to work with various operating
                            systems and Integrated Development Environments or IDEs. It was originally developed in 2005
                            by Linus Torvalds.</p>
                        <p>Although Git is the most popular version control system in use today, there are numerous
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software"
                                target="_blank">alternatives</a>. What they all have in common is that they are software
                            tools used help a
                            software team manage changes in their source code. Not only can they be useful for team
                            projects but also be useful for individual projects as well.</p>

                        <p>Using version control software like Git can be very beneficial to a team and individual
                            projects. Version control software helps you keep track of changes to your source code. In
                            addition, if for some reason the latest changes made to your source code result in errors,
                            you can revert back to a previous version of your code and fix the error. If you‚Äôre working
                            with a team member, you can create separate copies of the code, work on different projects
                            and then merge both copies back to the original and the source code will be updated include
                            both team members changes.</p>
                        <p>Sounds handy right? Then let‚Äôs get started with some Git basics
                            to get you up and running.</p>

                        <p>The first thing you‚Äôll need to do is install Git. For Windows you can install Git Bash which
                            is an application for Microsoft Windows environment which installs both Git and Bash. It
                            provides you the ability to use both Git and Bash commands in the terminal on your computer.
                        </p>
                        <p>For Mac and Linux users, you likely already have Bash installed since its popular default
                            shell on these operating systems. To download Git, instructions are provided for each
                            operating system below:</p>
                        <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>
                        <p>Once you have Git install, open up the Bash (for windows open up Git Bash) terminal, and
                            let‚Äôs make sure you have Git downloaded and running correctly. In the terminal type:</p>
                        <code>git --version</code>
                        <p>If you installed it correctly you should see the version of Git that is currently installed.
                        </p>

                        <p>Next, we‚Äôll configure Git to identify you by adding your username and email. In the Bash
                            terminal we will do the following:</p>
                        <p>To Update Username:</p>
                        <code>git config --global user.name ‚ÄúYour Name‚Äù</code>
                        <p>To Update Email:</p>
                        <code>git config --global user.email ‚ÄúYour Email‚Äù</code>
                        <p>These configurations will be simply used to identify who made what changes in your source
                            code.</p>

                                Bash Terminal. Using these commands will be useful so that you can add your Git
                                repostitory file to correct location.</p>
                            <p>pwd ‚Äì stands for print working directory. This Git command will show the current folder
                                or file you are in.
                                For
                                example, type the following in the terminal:</p>
                            <code>pwd</code>
                            <p>The terminal should return the current location you are in as such: </p>

                            <p>For example, if your terminal is

                                your main project you would type the following:</p>
                            <code>cd css</code>
                            <p>Then type:</p>

                        <p>First, make sure your working directory in the terminal is currently located in your
                            project's
                            root folder (the main folder that contains all your project files). To create a new Git
                            repository for your project, type the following:</p>
                        <code>git init</code>
                        <p>This will create a .git file in your root folder of the project. To see this file in the
                            terminal type the following:</p>
                        <code>ls -a</code>
                        <p>The ls command allows you to see the files listed in the working directory. The ls -a command
                            allows you to see all files including hidden files. Since the .git file is considered a
                            hidden
                            file, without the -a command, you would not be able to see the .git file listed in your root
                            folder.</p>
                        <p>Now you have created a Git repository that will keep track and save the changes you make to
                            your source code. Next, we will need to add your project files to the Git repository to keep
                            track of the changes that are made in your source code.</p>

                        <p>After you have created your new Git Repository, if you already have files in your project
                            folder type the following in the terminal to see what files and changes to the source code
                            have not been added to your Git Repository:</p>
                        <code>git status</code>
                        <p>The git status command is a great way to see what files have not been added to the
                            repository. It is also useful in giving you suggestions on what steps to take next when you
                            forget how to add files to your repository.</p>
                        <p>If you have one file or just want to add specific files to the
                            repository you can type:</p>
                        <code>git add filename</code>
                        <p>For example, to add just one file:</p>
                        <code>git add README.md</code>
                        <p>To add multiple files:</p>
                        <code>git add README.md index.html</code>
                        <p>If you have multiple files to add to your repository and you don't want list each file, you
                            can add all files at once using the following command:</p>
                        <code>git add .</code>
                        <p>Now your files been added to a staging area. The staging area is the step prior to committing
                            your files to your Git repository. This process is similar to adding files to a holding area
                            before committing the changes to be made to your Git repository. Adding files to the staging
                            area provides you opportunity to review your files before officially committing them to the
                            repository.</p>
                        <p>Now when you type <code>git status</code> you should see the files you added listed under
                            changes to be committed.</p>
                        <p>To commit your changes type:</p>
                        <code>git commit -m "Type a brief message of the changes you did"</code>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <code>git commit ‚Äìm ‚ÄúAdded index.html file‚Äù</code>
                        <p>This will add a new commit and document what changes were made.</p>
                        <p>Alright! You made your first commit! To view the history of your commits that you have made
                            type:</p>
                        <code>git log</code>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> When finished viewing git log, press <code>q</code> to quit out of the
                            log</p>
                        <p>The git log command will show you a list of all commits you have made in your Git repository.
                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, we will go over how to send your changes to a remote repository so that you may
                            access your files from anywhere.</p>

                            working on one computer or laptop and you do not plan to share your source code, you are not
                            required to do any
                            of these next steps. You simply would continue to make commits in your local machine.
                            However,
                            what if you want to work on a project from another computer or for some
                            reason you are unable to access your local machine? That is where remote repositories come
                            in and you may want to strongly consider having a back up even if you are working on a
                            solo project.</p>
                        <p>Remote repositories allow you to keep a back up of your source code that you
                            or
                            another
                            developer can download and access on another machine. Websites such as GitHub, GitLab, and
                            BitBucket make this process possible to do since they can store your code and provide
                            options
                            on whether or not your code to be accessible to others. These websites also make it possible
                            for teams to work together on a commercial or open-source projects as well.</p>
                        <p>There are several <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/8/github-alternatives"
                                target="_blank">options</a> to choose from when setting up a remote repository but today
                            we
                            will use GitHub since it one of the most popular sites to manage code remotely.</p>
                        <div id="create_github_account">
                            <h3>Creating a GitHub Account</h3>
                            <p>The first step is to create a GitHub Account. Go to <a href="https://github.com"
                                    target="blank">https://github.com</a> and create an account if you don't already
                                have one. Be sure to choose the Free subscription plan. Once you have created one,
                                locate the new
                                repository button on the GitHub website and click new repository:</p>
                            <img src="https://placeimg.com/500/200/tech" />
                            <p>Next, choose a name for your repository that relates to your current project. Then,
                                select whether you want your repository to be public or private
                                (typically if it‚Äôs a project you want to show or share with others you select public;
                                otherwise, you can choose private). </p>
                            <p>Lastly, since we already have an existing repository on our local machine and plan to
                                send our files to a remote repository in GitHub you can skip initializing repository
                                with README and adding a license. You can always create these files in your local
                                repository and send it to your remote repository later.</p>

                        <div id="push_to_remote">
                            <h3>Pushing Our Changes to the Remote Repository in GitHub (git remote, git commit commands)
                            </h3>
                            <p>Now that your remote repository in GitHub is set up, copy the url listed for your new
                                repository. It should look something similar to this:</p>
                            <code>https://github.com/my-username/my-new-repository-name.git</code>
                            <p> Now go back to your terminal, and we will associate our local repository to our remote
                                repository by typing the following:</p>
                            <code>git remote add origin your-repository-url</code>
                            <p>In place of "your-repository-url" you will copy paste the url of your new repository from
                                GitHub like the following:</p>
                            <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/my-username/my-new-repository-name.git</code>
                            <p>Next, we will push our changes to the master branch in our remote repository on GitHub by
                                typing the following:</p>
                            <code>git push ‚Äìu origin master</code>
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> -u is only required the very first time you are pushing changes to
                                a new remote
                                repository. Any future git push commands you want to do in the same repository, you can
                                exclude the -u as such:</p>
                            <code>git push origin master</code>
                            <p>In the previous command, origin is the default name given to the remote repository and a
                                way to identify the remote repostiory you are connecting to.
                                The name master
                                is the default name given to the branch in your remote repository on GitHub. Both of the
                                default names can be changed but it may be best to learn more about how branches work if
                                you decide to use names other than the default. Examples in this technical documentation
                                will use the default names. To learn more about
                                branches visit

                            <p>To ensure the files were sent to GitHub in your remote repository, check your GitHub
                                Account
                                to see if your remote repository has any updates that
                                were made in the repository. You should see your project files from your local machine
                                now
                                added in
                                your the repository you created in GitHub.</p>

                        <p>Congrats! You now have a basic understanding of Git, the Bash Terminal, and
                            GitHub. We covered a variety of topics today including:</p>
                        <ul class="summary-list">
                            <li>How to set up Git, Bash, and Git Bash for windows</li>
                            <li>How to use common Git commands</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The topics we went over today are incredibly useful when managing your own projects as well
                            as team projects. These tools allow you to keep track of changes made to your source code,
                            share your project with others for collaboration and allow you to go back to previous
                            versions of your source code to correct errors or rollback unwanted changes made. These
                            tools are used among experienced and new developers alike so practicing with these tools now
                            will help you get up to speed with working in team projects.</p>
