                    <p>Git is a version control system that is used to keep track of changes made in your
                        development project. Git is also the most widely used version control system for both
                        commercial and open-source projects due to its ability to work with various operating
                        systems and Integrated Development Environments or IDEs. It was originally developed in 2005
                        by Linus Torvalds.</p>
                    <p>Although Git is the most popular version control system in use today, there are numerous
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">alternatives</a>. What they all have in common is that they
                        are software
                        tools used help a
                        software team manage changes in their source code. Not only can they be useful for team
                        projects but also be useful for individual projects as well.</p>

                    <p>Using version control software like Git can be very beneficial to a team and individual
                        projects. Version control software helps you keep track of changes to your source code. In
                        addition, if for some reason the latest changes made to your source code result in errors,
                        you can revert back to a previous version of your code and fix the error. If you‚Äôre working
                        with a team member, you can create separate copies of the code, work on different projects
                        and then merge both copies back to the original and the source code will be updated include
                        both team members changes.</p>
                    <p>Sounds handy right? Then let‚Äôs get started with some Git basics
                        to get you up and running.</p>

                    <p>The first thing you‚Äôll need to do is install Git. For Windows you can install Git Bash which
                        is an application for Microsoft Windows environment which installs both Git and Bash. It
                        provides you the ability to use both Git and Bash commands in the terminal on your computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>For Mac and Linux users, you likely already have Bash installed since its popular default
                        shell on these operating systems. To download Git, instructions are provided for each
                        operating system below:</p>

                        rel="noopener noreferrer">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>
                    <p>Once you have Git install, open up the Bash (for windows open up Git Bash) terminal, and
                        let‚Äôs make sure you have Git downloaded and running correctly. In the terminal type:</p>
                    <pre><code>git --version</code></pre>
                    <p>If you installed it correctly you should see the version of Git that is currently installed.
                    </p>

                    <p>Next, we‚Äôll configure Git to identify you by adding your username and email. In the Bash
                        terminal we will do the following:</p>
                    <p>To Update Username:</p>
                    <pre><code>git config --global user.name ‚ÄúYour Name‚Äù</code></pre>

                    <pre><code>git config --global user.email ‚ÄúYour Email‚Äù</code></pre>
                    <p>These configurations will be simply used to identify who made what changes in your source
                        code.</p>

                            the
                            Bash Terminal. Using these commands will be useful so that you can add your Git

                        <p>pwd ‚Äì stands for print working directory. This Git command will show the current folder
                            or file you are in.
                            For
                            example, type the following in the terminal:</p>
                        <pre><code>pwd</code></pre>
                        <p>The terminal should return the current location you are in as a full filepath or relative

                        <p>A relative path file:</p>
                        <pre><code>~/your_username</code></pre>
                        <p>This command is useful in helping you identify where you are currently in your terminal.

                        <p>cd ‚Äì stands for change directory which allows you to change from the current folder or
                            file you are currently in to a new folder or file.</p>
                        <p>For example, say your project files are set up like below in your Desktop and your
                            terminal is
                            currently in your main project folder (technical-doc-page folder) and you wanted to
                            change the current location of your terminal to
                            the css folder within
                            your main project:</p>
                        <img class="dir-image" src="images/directory_example.JPG"
                            alt="Image clip of a folder listing project files and folders in Visual Studio Code Software">
                        <p>Your current working directory would look something like this after typing pwd in the Git
                            Bash Terminal:</p>
                        <pre><code>/C/Users/your_username/Desktop/technical-doc-page</code></pre>
                        <p>To go into the css folder using the terminal, you would type the following:</p>
                        <pre><code>cd css</code></pre>
                        <p>Then type:</p>
                        <pre><code>pwd</code></pre>
                        <p>The terminal working directory will change from:</p>
                        <pre><code>/C/Users/your_username/Desktop/technical-doc-page</code></pre>
                        <p>To:</p>

                        <p>Now your current working directory is in the css of your directory and you can add or

                    </header>
                    <h3 class="subtitle">(git init command)</h3>
                    <p>First, make sure your working directory in the terminal is currently located in your
                        project's
                        main folder (this is the folder that would contain all the files related to your specific
                        project). If you don't have a project or want just want to practice, create a new folder,
                        give it a name (avoid having spaces in your project folder names! This causes issues
                        accessing them using Git Bash) and save it on the Desktop.
                        Then create a README.md text file and save it in the new
                        folder.</p>
                    <p>Next, make sure your Git Bash terminal working directory is located inside your new
                        folder by using the pwd and cd commands (Or use the quick tip I showed you earlier to
                        quickly
                        navigate to the folder).</p>
                    <p>To create a new Git
                        repository for your project, type the following:</p>
                    <pre><code>git init</code></pre>
                    <p>This will create a .git file in your root or main folder of the project. To see this file in
                        the
                        terminal type the following Bash command:</p>
                    <pre><code>ls -a</code></pre>
                    <p>The ls command allows you to see the files listed in the working directory. The ls -a command
                        allows you to see all files including hidden files. Since the .git file is considered a
                        hidden
                        file, without the -a command, you would not be able to see the .git file listed in your root
                        folder.</p>
                    <p>Now you have created a Git repository that will keep track and save the changes you make to
                        your source code. Next, we will need to add your project files to the Git repository to keep
                        track of the changes that are made in your source code.</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">(git
                        add, git commit commands)</h3>
                    <p>After you have created your new Git Repository, if you already have files in your project
                        folder type the following in the terminal to see what files and changes to the source code
                        have not been added to your Git Repository:</p>
                    <pre><code>git status</code></pre>
                    <p>The git status command is a great way to see what files have not been added to the
                        repository. It is also useful in giving you suggestions on what steps to take next when you
                        forget how to add files to your repository.</p>
                    <p>If you have one file or just want to add specific files to the
                        repository you can type:</p>
                    <pre><code>git add filename</code></pre>
                    <p>For example, to add just one file:</p>
                    <pre><code>git add README.md</code></pre>
                    <p>To add multiple files:</p>
                    <pre><code>git add README.md index.html</code></pre>
                    <p>If you have multiple files to add to your repository and you don't want list each file, you
                        can add all files at once using the following command:</p>
                    <pre><code>git add .</code></pre>
                    <p>Now your files been added to a staging area. The staging area is the step prior to committing
                        your files to your Git repository. This process is similar to adding files to a holding area
                        before committing the changes to be made to your Git repository. Adding files to the staging
                        area provides you opportunity to review your files before officially committing them to the
                        repository.</p>
                    <p>Now when you type:</p>
                    <pre><code>git status</code></pre>
                    <p>you should see the files you added, listed under changes to be committed.</p>
                    <p>To commit your changes type:</p>
                    <pre><code>git commit -m "Type a brief message of the changes you did"</code></pre>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <pre><code>git commit ‚Äìm ‚ÄúAdded README.md file‚Äù</code></pre>
                    <p>This will add a new commit and document what changes were made.</p>
                    <p>Alright! You made your first commit! To view the history of your commits that you have made
                        type:</p>
                    <pre><code>git log</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Quick Tip!</strong> When finished viewing git log, press</p>
                    <pre><code>q</code></pre> 
                    <p>to quit out of the log</p>
                    <p>The git log command will show you a list of all commits you have made in your Git repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lastly, we will go over how to send your changes to a remote repository so that you may
                        access your files from anywhere.</p>

                    <p>Up to this point we have made commits to our local repository. If you are typically
                        working on one computer or laptop and you do not plan to share your source code, you are not
                        required to do any
                        of these next steps. You simply would continue to make commits in your local machine.
                        However,
                        what if you want to work on a project from another computer or for some
                        reason you are unable to access your local machine? That is where remote repositories come
                        in and you may want to strongly consider having a back up even if you are working on a
                        solo project.</p>
                    <p>Remote repositories allow you to keep a back up of your source code that you
                        or
                        another
                        developer can download and access on another machine. Websites such as GitHub, GitLab, and
                        BitBucket make this process possible to do since they can store your code and provide
                        options
                        on whether or not you want your code to be accessible to others. These websites also make it
                        possible
                        for teams to work together on commercial or open-source projects as well.</p>
                    <p>There are several <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/8/github-alternatives"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">options</a> to choose from when setting up a
                        remote repository but today
                        we
                        will use GitHub since it one of the most popular sites to manage code remotely.</p>

                        <a class="anchor" href="#">
                            <h3 class="subtitle">Creating a GitHub Account</h3>
                        </a>
                        <p>The first step is to create a GitHub Account. Go to <a href="https://github.com"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com</a>
                            and create an account if you don't already
                            have one. Be sure to choose the Free subscription plan. Once you have created one,
                            locate the new
                            repository button on the GitHub website and click new repository:</p>
                        <img class="new-repo-img" src="images/github_newrepo.JPG"
                            alt="Image clip of GitHub account showing button for new repository option and search box for existing repositories" />
                        <p>Next, choose a name for your repository that relates to your current project. Then,
                            select whether you want your repository to be public or private
                            (typically if it‚Äôs a project you want to show or share with others you select public;
                            otherwise, you can choose private). </p>
                        <p>Lastly, since we already have an existing repository on our local machine and plan to
                            send our files to a remote repository in GitHub you can skip initializing repository
                            with README and adding a license. You can always create these files in your local
                            repository and send it to your remote repository later.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Pushing Our Changes to the Remote Repository in GitHub

                        <h4 class="subtitle">(git remote, git commit commands)</h4>
                        <p>Now that your remote repository in GitHub is set up, copy the url listed for your new
                            repository. It should look something similar to this:</p>
                        <pre><code>https://github.com/my-username/my-new-repository-name.git</code></pre>
                        <p> Now go back to your terminal, and we will associate our local repository to our remote
                            repository by typing the following:</p>
                        <pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/my-username/my-new-repository-name.git</code></pre>
                        <p>Next, we will push our changes to the master branch in our remote repository on GitHub by
                            typing the following:</p>
                        <pre><code>git push ‚Äìu origin master</code></pre>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> -u is only required the very first time you are pushing changes to
                            a new remote
                            repository. Any future git push commands you want to do in the same repository, you can
                            exclude the -u as such:</p>
                        <pre><code>git push origin master</code></pre>
                        <p>In the previous command, origin is the default name given to the remote repository and a
                            way to identify the remote repostiory you are connecting to.
                            The name master
                            is the default name given to the branch in your remote repository on GitHub. Both of the
                            default names can be changed but it may be best to learn about how git repository
                            branches work if
                            you decide to use names other than the default. Examples in this technical documentation
                            will use the default names. To learn more about

                    <p>The topics we went over today are incredibly useful when managing your own projects as well
                        as team projects. These tools allow you to keep track of changes made to your source code,
                        share your project with others for collaboration and allow you to go back to previous
                        versions of your source code to correct errors or rollback unwanted changes made. These
                        tools are used among experienced and new developers alike so practicing with these tools now
                        will help you get up to speed with working in team projects.</p>
                    <p>Although we covered various topics today, there is still much more learn about Git. Below are
